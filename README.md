## üöÄ Overview

DC Aws is a group of professional pet experts coming from different fields in animal care sectors. Our community is a non-profit forum and we are proud to give needful information to pet owners üêæ.

For this project, I got the idea of making a pet sitter landing page when I had to take care of my friend's cats during their trip to Spain. And here again, I have another chance to optimize my knowledge in using **[HyperText Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=The%20HyperText%20Markup%20Language%20or,(HyperText%20Markup%20Language)) and [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)** languages to code.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Learning Objectives

After fulfilling the project, I acquire knowledge to:
* Build and style static webpages with semantic **HTML** and **CSS**
* Implement best practices and standards when structuring HTML files using nested elements, indentation, comments, and line breaks
* Implement the use of adding **Images & Links** into HTML, using **`<ul>, <ol>, so on`tags** to present the content of the project
* Implement CSS styling via class, id and element selectors using external stylesheets and inline styles and box model for HTML elements
* Implement **Bootstrap** styling, **Mailchimp**, **Google font**, **Font Awesome**, **CSS breakpoints** and **Navigation** with **Responsive web design** theory
* Use **Git workflow** to initialize projects, track changes, and host via remote server
* Execute live deployment using **GitHub** Pages

## üìã Requirements

**Build an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks/)**

**User Stories:** 
1. Your product landing page should have a `header` element with a corresponding `id="header"`
2. You can see an image within the `header` element with a corresponding `id="header-img"` (A logo would make a good image here)
3. Within the `#header` element, you can see a nav element with a corresponding `id="nav-bar"`
4. You can see at least three clickable elements inside the `nav` element, each with the class `nav-link`
5. When you click a `.nav-link` button in the `nav` element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page
6. You can watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`
7. Your landing page has a `form` element with a corresponding `id="form"`
8.  Within the form, there is an `input` field with `id="email"` where you can enter an email address
9. The `#email` input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for
10. The `#email` input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address
11. Within the form, there is a submit `input` with a corresponding `id="submit"`
12. When you click the `#submit` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: `https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit`)
13. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport
14. Your product landing page should have at least one media query
15. Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once
